	<h4> Hi honey, I am experimenting with building a website and need some content so let me tell you a <em> True </em> story </H4>
</section>

<section>
	<p> Before the night that I met you, I was contemplating not showing up to Brewers at Yancey. Coming off a busy workweek on a new client (Rhode Island) coupled with back to back MBA in-person classes, I was 	feeling super drained. There was a voice inside of me stating, "Just 	take it easy tonight and relax." <br> However, I felt God pulling on my heartstrings as I had made this commitment weeks ago to attend the Hope church event. At the last second, I forced myself out of bed and into my car. Aren't you glad I ended up going? I sure am hehe.</p>
